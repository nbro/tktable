# tktable

This is a wrapper of the `Tcl/Tk` `Tktable` widget for Python written by [Guilherme Polo](https://github.com/gpolo). See license below by the author for more information.


### Language

### How to use

Just copy the file [`tktable.py`](tktable.py) to your working directory and import `tktable.py` normally. You could also, for example, copy the module to the `site-packages` folder under your Python distribution, so that you don't have to copy everytime the module to all your projects.
